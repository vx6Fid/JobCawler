## ðŸš§ This README Needs Therapy
Yeah, yeah â€” I know. This README is more of a placeholder than a guide right now. 

But donâ€™t worry, itâ€™ll get a **glow-up**... eventually. Once the project is done cooking, the README will stop looking like it was written at 2 AM on caffeine and existential dread ðŸ« .

> Stay tuned â€” future-me will make it beautiful. Probably.
